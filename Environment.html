            <h2>ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION</h2>
            <P>Our environment is nature’s most precious and vital gift, which needs to be handled with utmost care. It is the natural ecological system where we live, depending on each other for survival. The environment is divided into physical and biological components. The atmosphere, lithosphere and hydrosphere constitute the physical category, and the biological category comprises human beings and other living beings.</P>

        Prevents illness and sickness
        Germs and diseases can spread far more quickly in an unclean environment. The health and safety of your employees is incredibly important, and a key part of that is preventing the spread of any harmful bacteria or germs. Businesses who fail to keep a clean work environment may see an increase in sick days and absences among staff, which can have a damaging impact on overall productivity.
        
        
        Good for employee wellbeing
        Employee wellbeing has become a hot topic in recent years, and it’s more important than ever for managers and directors to ensure the happiness of those working for them. Cluttered and dirty environments can lead to stress and a lack of focus - when your surroundings aren’t clean, it can be hard to focus the mind.
        
        
        Increases productivity
        On a related note, a super-clean environment is one of the best routes to success in business. Your employees will feel more relaxed and more focused - the perfect combination for increasing productivity. We can easily become distracted by thoughts hitting us from all directions but at least your employees won’t be worrying about the mess!
        
        
        Ensures safety
        Not only does a dirty environment have the potential to cause illness, it can also cause injury! Cluttered workplaces can lead to trips and slips, while spillages that go uncleaned are a serious safety hazard. To avoid any incidents, it’s essential that you take health and safety seriously and ensure that your workplace adheres to high standards.
